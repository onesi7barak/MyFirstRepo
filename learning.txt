So far in the *Introduction to Linux Commands* course,
I've learned how powerful and efficient the command line can be for 
navigating and managing a Linux system. 
One of the most useful skills I've gained is understanding how to use basic 
commands like ls, cd, mkdir, and touch to interact with files and directories.
Iâ€™ve also learned how to view file contents with commands like cat, less, 
and head, and how to manage file permissions using chmod.
